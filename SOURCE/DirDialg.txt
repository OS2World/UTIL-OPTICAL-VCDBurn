Purpose:
========
DirDialg() is a dialog similar to the system file dialog. In contrast
to the latter it is NOT used to select individual files, but a directory
from a list.


"Foreword:"
===========
This is one of the first little programs I created with VX-REXX (in
fact, created with REXX at all). Therefore please be gentle with me. ;-)
Of course, comments, suggestions (especially how to improve the speed
of the "VRDir" stuff used to fill the directory list with directory
names), bug reports (or even patches!) are highly appreciated.

I used VX-REXX version 2.0 patchlevel B to develop this, but I guess it
could work with 1.x too. (If someone verifies this, please TELL ME
about it!)

There's a little "demo program" that runs "DirDialog" and displays
the selected directory on exit in a console window. To run DEMO.EXE,
you need the VX-REXX runtime library VROBJ.DLL.

* BTW, "DirDialog" is postcard-ware. If you use it in an application that *
* is NOT only used by yourself (i.e. if you distribute it to others),     *
* you MUST register it. To register, please send me a postcard of your    *
* home town, or my lawyers will sue you. (Nah, just kiddin' ;-)           *


Installation:
============
To install, just add the line

	VRX: DirDialg.VRX

to your projects .VRP file, below the other "VRX:" lines. That's all!


Usage:
=====

dir = DirDialg( VRWindow(), caption, startdir )

    caption:  the dialog window's title (default: "Select a directory")
    startdir: the directory initially displayed when you call DirDialg()
                (default: the current working directory at the time your
                application was started)
    dir:      either a directory you selected or "" if you pressed
                "Cancel."
